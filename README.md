# KebukeOrder

This here is the final assignment for Peter's swift class. It's an app that help student in his class to order drink and post its order to Airtable API.
I made this app within 4 days without a stroyboard so the UI probably isn't the best. If you still want to download it and give it a shot, you should know that you need to have an Airtable API and an exact Airtable columns' name as mine to make this project work.
Otherwise, you will have to recreate your own data model. Here's an screenshot of my Airtable data.!

And here's a screenshot from the app. (totally want to show more but the files are too big..oops. It's just for demonstration tho. should be fine.)
