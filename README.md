# KebukeOrder

This here is the final assignment for Peter's swift class. It's an app that help students in his class to order drink and post their orders to Airtable.
I made this app within 4 days or so without a stroyboard ,so the UI probably isn't the best.
Here's the link to a medium article on my deep dive into this side project.

Here's a screenshot from the app! (totally want to show more but the files are too big..oops. It's just for demonstration tho. should be fine.)
